Koa.js is created by the same team that created Express.js. The aim of koa.js is to be smaller, more expressive and more robust than express. 
They are using async functions instead of callbacks which greatly helps with error handling and helps in avoiding callback hell. 
Koa is designed to be lightweight and more readable.
