ABORT READFILE

In order to abort an ongoing fileHandler event, we must have an abortable fileHandler event.
In order to create an abortable fileHandler event, we must first create an abort controller using const controller = new AbortController();.
After that we must assign the controller.signal to a signal variable. We will then pass that value while creating the readFile event.
readFile(fileInfo[0].name, { signal }, (err, buf) => {...
After we pass the signal to the readFile event we can abort this event by calling controller.abort(); anywhere we want.

ALTERNATIVE TO READFILE FOR MORE EFFICIENCY

According to the official documents fs.readFile() function buffers the entire file. Instead of doing it like that, using fs.createReadStream()
is more efficient in terms of memory usage. So the official documents recommends using fs.createReadStream() whenever possible.
